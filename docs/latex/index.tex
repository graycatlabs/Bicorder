I put this project together for the O\+SH Park Bring A Hack meetup at the 2016 Bay Area Maker Faire. It\textquotesingle{}s Tricorder inspired, but can\textquotesingle{}t quite sense everything, so the name \char`\"{}\+Bicorder\char`\"{} seemed fitting. It currently has a 3-\/axis magnetometer, a relative humidity / temperature sensor and an infrared range finder. It uses a 128x32 pixel monochrome L\+CD from Newhaven, which is divided into left and right sections, each displaying one of\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item live plot of temperature (in Celsius)
\item live plot of relative humidity
\item live plot of magnetic field (Z-\/axis) in u\+Tesla
\item a compass display (using the mag X and Y)
\item a distance readout in cm
\end{DoxyItemize}
